This repository consists of highlights of useful data/signal visualizations I've built in Processing.

The "Butterfly Curve" is a straighforward plotting method for illustrating the signal. It plots the points regularly along a path using the parametric equation along a specific formula for a curve.

The [Velocity and Acceleration](https://github.com/jbrdge/DataInProcessing/tree/master/Velocity_And_Acceleration) file consists of a processing file which randomly drops points into the window and through "gravitaion" the points are attracted to a point that is moving according to a sine function around the window. The white is the path of the rotational object.

The "Closed Polygon Spiral" is a closed form equation for a n-gon used to create the shape, with resizing of the plot to create an illusion of a spiral.

The "Varying Rates Parametric" is a non-object form illustrating combined sinusoidals with the function of being able to control the rates. It uses a for loop to call the function's points.
