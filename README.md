The bank processing file pulls data from the binary classification file "banks.csv". It displays the data on radar plots separated by classification. There are no feature labels on the sets to provide more information on the plots.

The "Butterfly Curve" is a straighforward plotting method for illustrating the signal. It plots the points regularly along a path using the torus equation along a specific formula for a curve.

The "Velocity and Acceleration" folder consists of a processing file which randomly drops points into the window and through "gravitaion" the points are attracted to a point that is moving according to a sine function around the window. The white is the path of the rotational object.

The closed form equation for a n-gon is used to create the shape. There is resizing of the plot to create an illusion of a spiral.
